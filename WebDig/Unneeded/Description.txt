Let's also create the FeedbackWriter class that's used in the original code to capture console output and redirect it to the UI:




Implementation Explanation
1. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
The frontend is a responsive web application that mimics the layout and functionality of the original Windows Forms application:

HTML Structure:

Uses a card-based layout with separate sections for query settings and results
Input fields for DNS server, query, and other settings
Dropdown selects for QType and QClass
Checkboxes and radio buttons for options
Navigation controls for query history


CSS Styling:

Completely custom CSS with no external libraries
Responsive design using media queries
Flexbox layout for form elements
Similar look and feel to the original application


JavaScript Logic:

Communicates with the backend API
Handles form submission and validation
Manages query history (like the original application)
Displays results in a monospaced font similar to the original UI
Handles UI interactions like toggling modals and word wrap



2. Backend (ASP.NET Minimal API)
The backend is implemented as an ASP.NET Core Minimal API:

API Endpoints:

/api/qtypes - Gets available QType options
/api/qclasses - Gets available QClass options
/api/default-dns - Gets the default DNS server
/api/dig - Performs the DNS query


Special Handling:

Captures console output similar to the original application
Maintains the same query functionality
Handles ARPA conversion for PTR and NAPTR records
Forces TCP for AXFR zone transfers



How to Deploy

Create an ASP.NET Core Web Application project
Add the HTML file to the wwwroot folder
Add the API code to your Program.cs file
Make sure your port of the Heijden.DNS library is properly referenced
Run with dotnet run or publish for deployment

This implementation preserves all the functionality from the original Windows Forms application while providing a modern, responsive web interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
